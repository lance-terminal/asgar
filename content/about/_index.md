## Hi, I am Asgar
More commonly known by my handle `lance-terminal`. I am a Cybersecurity professional with specialization in DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response). I served in US Marines as a heavy equipment operator. 

I am `GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH)` and `GIAC Certified Intrusion Analyst (GCIA)`, with years of experience in responding and investigating ransomware and business email compromise attacks when companies are actively under threat.

I build the site to share my experience and learning journey to anyone who is interesting in learning with me. I thank you for visiting my site today, and am happy to be part of your journey to making the cyber realm a safer place.

If you find my work valuable, consider buying me a coffee to support my work. I can always appreciate that.
