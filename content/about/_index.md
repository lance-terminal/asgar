## Hi, I am Asgar
More commonly known by my handle `lance-terminal`. I am a Cybersecurity professional with specialization in DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response). I served in US Marines as a heavy equipment operator. Random, I know.

I have experience in system administration, cloud engineering, security engineering, and of course, incident response. I built this site as a resource to help professionals and organizations for stronger security, and efficient incident response. 

If you are a seasoned professional, I hope you find this valuable. If you are here to learn something new or just new to cybersecurity in general, welcome. You can also subscribe to my weekly newsletter to stay updated on current events on global cyber. 

If you find my work valuable, consider buying me a coffee to support my work. I can always appreciate that.
