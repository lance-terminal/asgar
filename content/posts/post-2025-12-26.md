The cybersecurity job market is rough right now. AI hype, a shaky economy, ghost jobs, and endless LinkedIn “wins” make rejection feel personal. If you’re new and struggling to break in, hear this first:

**You’re not broken.**

I’m not here to give resume hacks or interview tricks. What I _can_ offer is perspective. Everyone enters cybersecurity differently. This is how I got into DFIR—and what actually mattered.

### How It Started
I’ve always liked computers. In high school, I tried to take apart our family PC and learned why static electricity kills hardware. That was our only computer, and replacing it wasn’t an option.

So I learned. Chipsets. BIOS. Compatibility. I found a cheap motherboard that fit my CPU, rebuilt the system, and got it working. Not perfectly—but enough.

That mistake forced real learning. It started everything.

### First Exposure to IT
I began helping teachers, friends, and family with tech issues. That led to a paid summer internship through my high school. For the first time, I saw enterprise IT: Active Directory, servers, Windows Pro vs Home.

It was eye-opening—and fun. That summer locked in my interest.

### Struggle Phase
Adulthood hit fast. I worked whatever paid rent—restaurants, valet, delivery—while attending college. College was expensive and draining. At the same time, I was enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve.

Trying to do _everything at once_ nearly broke me.

Advice to anyone early on: **do one thing well.** There is no finish line where life gets easy. Just different problems.

### Breaking Into Cybersecurity
Through the military, I joined VET TEC and earned Security+, CEH, and Splunk certifications. Security+ mattered most—not because it made me an expert, but because it gave me confidence.

A month later, I landed an MSP role doing cloud administration and support. I learned Azure and how cloud connects to on-prem IT.

Then came night shift. Alone. Full responsibility. Triage everything.

It was brutal—and invaluable.

### First Real Security Role
I moved to an automotive manufacturing company as a Security Analyst. The team was lean, so I handled incident response, security engineering, and sysadmin work.

Six months in, I was the only security person. I asked for the title and pay to match the work and became a Security Engineer.

I stayed for years. I was allowed to make mistakes and fix them. I earned GSEC and GCIH through SANS, got strong at incident timelines and forensics, and discovered CTFs—which massively accelerated my skills.

### Burnout and Reset
Doing everything eventually led to burnout. I stepped away, reflected, earned GCIA, and decided to build my own practice focused on securing infrastructure and incident response.

The road hasn’t been easy—but my view of cybersecurity changed. It became a craft. A balance between offense and defense.

### If You’re New to Cyber
If this is your first step into cybersecurity: **it does get better—but only if you put in the work.**

This field doesn’t require genius. I barely made it through college while working full-time, serving in the reserves, and driving Uber.

What it _does_ require is grit.

If you’re patient, willing to struggle, and committed to learning deeply, you will succeed. The journey isn’t easy—but that’s what makes it worth it.
