### Forensic Context
This walkthrough uses the `WebStrike` scenario from CyberDefenders.

**Artifact:** PCAP file containing network traffic  
**Goal:** Identify the attacker's geographic location

**Note:** To learn how to acquire PCAP files, see DocuSign's documentation on [How to do a Packet Capture (PCAP)](https://support.docusign.com/s/articles/How-to-do-a-Packet-Capture-PCAP?language=en_US).

First, establish the victim IP. You can identify your own IP using:
```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```
Or via [What Is My IP](https://whatismyipaddress.com).

### Finding the Attacker IP
With the victim IP established, identify network conversations in Wireshark: `Statistics → Conversations`.

The IPv4 tab shows one conversation:

- Address A: 117.11.88.124
- Address B: 24.49.63.79

The scenario didn't specify which IP is the victim, but mentioned the target was a web server. Check the TCP conversations tab (18 records):

Analyzing bytes and packets reveals anomalies:

`117.11.88.124` begins communicating from ports 443 and 8080 (server ports), yet sends 970 bytes across 162 packets—significantly higher activity than the ~5KB baseline seen in other connections. This pattern indicates scanning or exploitation rather than normal client behavior.

This IP is the attacker.
# Identifying Geolocation
Using [IPGeoLocation](https://ipgeolocation.io/) to query `117.11.88.124`:

**Limitations:** The reported location reflects where the IP is registered, not necessarily the attacker's physical location. Attackers commonly use proxies or VPNs to mask origin. In production environments, look for consistent TTPs across multiple IPs with varying geolocations—this pattern often indicates proxy use.
### Conclusion
Geolocation provides investigative context but should be corroborated with traffic pattern analysis and behavioral indicators. In noisy production environments, filtering techniques and anomaly detection become critical for accurate attribution.
